			<h3>Inroduction</h3>
			<p>
			  Game design is the art of applying design and aesthetics to create a game for entertainment or for educational, exercise, or experimental purposes. Increasingly, elements and principles of game design are also applied to other interactions, particularly virtual ones (see gamification).
			</p>
			<p>
			  Game design creates goals, rules and challenges to define a board game, card game, dice game, casino game, role-playing game, sport, video game, war game or simulation that produces desirable interactions among its participants and, possibly, spectators.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Academically, game design is part of game studies, while game theory studies strategic decision making (primarily in non-game situations). Games have historically inspired seminal research in the fields of probability, artificial intelligence, economics, and optimization theory. Applying game design to itself is a current research topic in metadesign.
			</p>
			<h3>Why I Like Game Design</h3>
			<p>
			I like to make things that other people enjoy. I enjoy art and have used this as a medium for expression before. However I find my skills limited within art. With Game Design I can make something that other people enjoy while also challenging myself mentally to make a simple game that is rich with strategy. It also allows me to tell a stroy without writing, which is a weakness of mine.
